## Reason For Choosing This Tech Stack


### Backend: Flask

1. Lightweight & Easy Setup: Flask is a Python microframework. It prioritizes simplicity, making it quick to learn and implement. It lets the developer focus on core functionalities of the Application Programming Interface (API).

2. Docker Friendly: Due to its minimalist nature, Flask creates smaller container images, leading to faster startup times and better resource utilization within Docker environments.


### Frontend: ReactJS

1. Component-Based Architecture: ReactJS utilizes a component-based structure, for reusable code. We can build independent UI elements and combine them to construct complex interfaces.

2. Virtual DOM & Performance: ReactJS employs a virtual DOM, allowing it to efficiently update only the necessary parts of the real DOM. This optimization ensures smooth user experience as the application scales with an increasing user base.


### Database: MongoDB

1. Scalable & Flexible Schema: MongoDB is a NoSQL document-oriented database. Unlike relational databases, it offers flexibility in data schema. It provides better scalability than MySQL.

2. Docker Compatibility: MongoDB offers containerized deployments, making it well-suited for Docker environments.
